## REQUIRED FILES FOR SHORTCUTS OVER AT:

## WHAT'S THIS?
*In an attempt to keep all my Shortcut links only on one location for any necessary updates, I'll do that directly on [MY SUBSTACK](https://afadingthought.substack.com/). This Github repository will have additional files that are necessary for the Shortcuts to run, but do visit the below links for specific instructions.*

*Thanks guys!*
