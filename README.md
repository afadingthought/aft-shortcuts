Alfred Worklow for Triggering Bear Capture Shortcut

YOU WILL NEED THIS SHORTCUT:
https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/4f1c4fe8b2164862b0ab59c0f397745f

## SETUP
1. The idea is to have an *inbox note* in Bear where everything that you capture on the go will end up. You have to create a note in Bear and go into Note/Copy Note’s Identifier.

2. The setup of the shortcut will also ask for an *inbox tag,* where any new notes created will go. I personally like to also insert this tag in my *inbox note* so that all the thoughts or ideas captured on the go are in the same place for me to come back and process later.

3. The Alfred Worklow should work as-is unless you change the name of the Shortcut—which by default is “Bear Capture.” You can go into the variables of the workflow and change the name there in case you need to. You will also want to customize all the Hotkeys so that they make sense to you.

## USE
* On your Mac the Shortcut was created to be run by Alfred, so it won’t work properly if you trigger it by itself.

* **On your iPhone, the shortcut will work with its most basic function: capturing text to your inbox note.** I like to trigger it with a widget from my ‘Today View’ and it runs on the background without even having to unlock my phone. I don’t have an iPad to test this, but it should be working in the same way.

* **To make the most out of the shortcut use it with Alfred.**

My keyboard has latin characters and the position of everything will be different depending on where in the world you are, so don’t expect the hotkeys to work out of the box for you. I also have to tell you that the hotkeys that open a note in a popup will only work properly if there’s no open windows of Bear in your current workspace. I talk about it in my [original video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pN61eSmzwzU&start=1260). *In this new shortcut I am sharing here, popups is the only time we have this limitation.*
